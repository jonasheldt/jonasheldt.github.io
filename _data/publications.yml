  quote: "Inside the automation stack at Audi—how MES/ERP, robotics, and scheduling rules shape work on the line."
  description: |
    An audio study of automated intralogistics at Audi: robots share aisles with humans, forklifts follow geofenced routes,
    and MES/ERP layers log every movement. From inside these stacks the piece maps how hiring screens, monitoring, and
    queueing rules shape task assignment and advancement. It listens for spillovers of automation adoption—how procurement shocks,
    capital budgeting cycles, and software rollouts surface in training, temp-to-perm pathways, and the lived tempo of shift work.

  quote: "The factory as data system—telemetry, rosters, KPIs—and people adapting to autonomous and machine intelligence production pipelines."
  description: |
    A close-up of algorithmic work in car manufacturing, following how AGV logistics, computer-vision safety systems,
    and predictive scheduling reshape everyday decisions on the line. The film reads the factory as a data system—telemetry,
    shift rosters, output KPIs—while watching people adapt: temp work cycles, training on-the-job with machine interfaces,
    and the leverage created by just-in-time risks. It traces how small changes in scheduling code or component buffers
    cascade into bargaining power, wages, and regional opportunity.

    Border-adjacent communities: how transport, housing, and seasonal employment couple together. Long drives to services,
    patchwork households, dual-job routines. The piece shows how small policy changes can lift individuals or sink them into poverty,
    and places the reportage in comparative note across regions with similar constraints.
