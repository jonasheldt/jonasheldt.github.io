    Designed and taught a classroom series introducing platform business models (subscriptions, ads, public service),
    the media value chain (development → production → distribution), and how recommender systems boost discovery.
    Hands-on activities included a simple production budget in spreadsheets, a mock “platform pitch,” and short-sequence
    breakdowns of camera, sound, and edit decisions in "Independence Day" (Dir: Roland Emmerich, 1996) to convey subtext on gay marriage. 
    A dedicated module traced milestones of queer cinema for age-appropriate discussion of representation, authorship, and context, 
    using curated excerpts with guided reflection.
