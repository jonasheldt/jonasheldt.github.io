    A study of the smart factory at AUDI, Automotive examines the algorithmic transformation of car manufacturing and its impact on work through the lens of machine intelligence, cyber-physical systems, and autonomous logistics. It documents the shift from human-centered production to AGV-coordinated supply chains, where predictive analytics, sensor fusion, and robotic process automation synchronize every step of assembly.

  quote: Graduation project on 9-axis motion-tracking robot in a automotive production environment.
  description: |
    In cooperation with Robotics Technology Leaders (rtleaders.com): manufacturing robot in virtual production setting. 
    Automated live motion tracking with real-time camera pose output for AR/XR
    (FreeD / equivalent tracking data). Outputs live pose and control metadata so a virtual-set engine can render a
    matched virtual camera in real time—enabling believable mixed-reality studios. High-DOF, ultra-smooth,
    repeatable multi-axis motion (robotic precision) distinguishes the system from standard pedestals/PTZs.
    Context: AGVs, machine-intelligence scheduling, and human–automation ethics on the factory floor.
    Tech: Mark Roberts Motion Control (MRMC), PTZOptics, AR/XR graphics engines.

    Algorithms, Computer Vision, Identity — sci-fi short inspired by the cypherpunk manifesto.
  description: |
    Narrative prototype exploring ubiquitous tracking and re-identification through modern computer-vision pipelines. 
    TRACKERS examines identity, privacy, and power asymmetries when intelligent machines have permeated public space. Visual language and sound design mirror the anxiety of
    dataset-driven profiling; thematically grounded in cypherpunk principles of privacy through cryptography.

    Thoreau’s Walden meets Underground Railroad — a dystopian sci-fi short film about escape and resistance.
  description: |
    A speculative journey that interweaves near-future world-building of an autocrat society with
    self-reliance and hacker groups seeking their Utopia. They use off-grid railways, clandestine relays, and the ethics of
    civil disobedience in retrofutoristic landscapes.
